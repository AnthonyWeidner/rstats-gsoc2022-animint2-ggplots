# Anthony Weidner GSoC 2022 Animated Interactive ggplots
Working with animint2, ggplots, and multiple data sets & images.

## Easy Tests
I tested out plot analysis and graphs on multiple data sets using skills learned from the animint2 Manual. I uploaded my visualizations to the web using animint2gist().

[Here](http://bl.ocks.org/AnthonyWeidner/raw/b4fea91dbd238e16c4409b6d30aad0bb/) is an example of an animint published using animint2gist(). I then reversed and changed the graph [here](http://bl.ocks.org/AnthonyWeidner/raw/92002723f587bebeb1448049dbc189da/) as part of the exercises in the animint manual. 

I also developed an interactive shinyDashboard app as part of visualizing University of California data using ggplots, allowing the user to change which data is presented.

## Medium Test
I implemented and translated flip.coin() into an animint.

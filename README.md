# rstats-gsoc2022-animint2-ggplots
Working with animint2, ggplots, and multiple data sets & images.

I tested out plot analysis and graphs on multiple data sets using skills learned from the animint2 Manual.



Note: The .md file contains the R code and generated plots, and the .Rmd file contains purely the code.

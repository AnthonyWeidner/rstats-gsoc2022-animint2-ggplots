# Anthony Weidner GSoC 2022 Animated Interactive ggplots
Working with animint2, ggplots, and multiple data sets & images.

## Easy Tests
I tested out plot analysis and graphs on multiple data sets using skills learned from the animint2 Manual.
Note: The .md file contains the R code and generated plots, and the .Rmd file contains purely the code.

I also developed an interactive shinyDashboard app as part of visualizing University of California data using ggplots, allowing the user to change which data is presented.

## Medium Test
I implemented and translated flip.coin() into an animint.

# rstats-gsoc2022-animint2-ggplots
Working with animint2, ggplots, and multiple data sets & images.

Easy Tests: I tested out plot analysis and graphs on multiple data sets using skills learned from the animint2 Manual.
Note: The .md file contains the R code and generated plots, and the .Rmd file contains purely the code. 

Medium Test: I implemented and translated flip.coin() into an animint. [Animation of coin flipping simulation](http://bl.ocks.org/AnthonyWeidner/raw/1b5acc50d6c8a70dc8dc037338593efe/)
